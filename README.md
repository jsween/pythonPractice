# pythonPractice

## By Jon Sweeney

### Notes

This is a collection of simple Python projects that I created for fun.  Often, my code
is overkill.  But I figured I would have a little fun with this.  After working in QA, I
appreciate trying to handle edge cases.

Also, this was a nice refresher on using command line and github.  

### Directions for use
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone or download repository
3. Unzip file
4. Using Terminal, navigate to directory
5. Type 'python exercise<x>.py'

#### Exercise 1
This is a python program for a user to enter their name, age and favorite number.

### Exercise 2
This is a simple program for a user to enter 2 numbers.  This checks if the numbers
are even or odd.  Then check if the first number is divisible by the second number

### Exercise 3
This program has the user enter a maximum number and gives a list of numbers less than
the user's number.

### Exercise 4
This program finds the divisors of a user's number

### Exercise 5
This program prints out the matches between two lists

### Exercise 6
2 solutions for palindromes.  Felt like skipping the loop solution was cheating

### Exercise 7
Discovering list comprehensions

### Exercise 8
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

### Exercise 9
Guess a Num Between 1 and 9 Game

#### To Do list
1. Add a check for inputs too high for type int
2. Add logic for a user's name with only 2 letters (eg KJ, TJ, CJ)
